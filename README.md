# Nemo Skills

Nemo-Skills is a collection of pipelines to improve "skills" of large language models (LLMs). We support everything needed for LLM development, from synthetic data generation, to model training, to evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Start developing on a local workstation and move to a large-scale Slurm cluster with just a one-line change.


Here are some of the features we support:

- [Flexible LLM inference](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/pipelines/generation/):
  - Seamlessly switch between API providers, local server and large-scale slurm jobs for LLM inference.
  - Host models (on 1 or many nodes) with [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) or [Megatron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM).
  - Scale SDG jobs from 1 GPU on a local machine all the way to tens of thousands of GPUs on a slurm cluster.
- [Model evaluation](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation):
  - Evaluate your models on many popular benchmarks.

## S2S FC Eval Scorecard

Tools for generating and viewing a single-page HTML scorecard that aggregates metrics from all S2S FC eval benchmarks (VoiceBench nonMCQ/MCQ, FDB, BBA, BFCL, conv_behav).

### Generating the scorecard

The scorecard is generated via a Claude Code slash command. Run it inside a `claude` session:

```
/make-scorecard
```

Optional arguments:

| Argument | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `name=<filename>` | Output HTML filename (`.html` appended if omitted) | `scorecard` |
| `output_dir=<path>` | Base output dir for all benchmarks; results are read from `{output_dir}/{mode}_{commit}/` | read from each benchmark's config YAML |
| `eval_mode=<mode>` | `greedy`, `sampling`, or `greedy+sampling` | `greedy+sampling` |

Examples:

```
/make-scorecard
/make-scorecard name=my_run
/make-scorecard name=my_run eval_mode=greedy
/make-scorecard name=my_run output_dir=/path/to/results eval_mode=greedy+sampling
```

Output is written to `asset/{name}.html`. The scorecard includes:
- Summary tiles and radar chart across all benchmarks
- Per-benchmark metric breakdowns (greedy and sampling side by side)
- Audio example playback for VoiceBench CommonEval, FDB turn-taking/pause, BBA Navigate, and conv_behav agent sessions

### Viewing the scorecard

Audio playback requires an HTTP server on the cluster. Run:

```bash
bash scripts/serve_scorecard.sh [--name <filename>] [--port <port>]
```

The script will:
1. List all available scorecards in `asset/` with their browser URLs
2. Start an HTTP server (auto-selects a free port in 8780–8799 if `--port` is omitted)
3. Print the SSH tunnel command to run on your laptop
4. Print the browser URL to open

Example output:

```
Available scorecards in .../asset/:
  http://localhost:8780/.../asset/scorecard.html
  http://localhost:8780/.../asset/my_run.html

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Run this on your LAPTOP:

    ssh -L 8780:127.0.0.1:8780 <user>@draco-oci-login-01.draco-oci-iad.nvidia.com -N &

  Then open in browser:
    http://localhost:8780/.../asset/my_run.html

  To stop the server:
    kill <PID>
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal running `serve_scorecard.sh` to stop the server.
