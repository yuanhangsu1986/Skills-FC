# OpenScienceReasoning Pipeline Quickstart
This folder provides templates, prompts, and scripts for the automated pipeline that powers the OpenScience data refresh. The pipeline launches distributed jobs through [`run_pipeline.py`](run_pipeline.py) and covers the full lifecycle: solution generation, ground-truth extraction, difficulty scoring, and topic labeling.

## Seed Data Flow
- Deduplicate and clean incoming problems via [`filter_problems`](scripts/filter_problems.py).
- Run contamination checks in [`decontaminate`](scripts/decontaminate.py).
- Launch [`generate_solutions`](run_pipeline.py) to obtain model answers when no GT is supplied, then run majority voting to recover a GT answer. Will only be applied with the `without_gt` setting.
- Profile problem difficulty with multiple models via [`profiling`](run_pipeline.py) and enrich metadata with [`topics_labeling`](run_pipeline.py).
- Finish with [`aggregate`](scripts/aggregate_metadata.py) and [`filter_solutions`](scripts/filter_solutions.py) to produce deliverables.

## SFT Data Flow
- Runs every step from the seed flow.
- Adds SFT formatting: [`generate_solutions`](run_pipeline.py) runs to gather model reasoning traces, then [`prepare_for_sft`](run_pipeline.py) formats instruction-tuning records and [`process_messages_and_bucket`](run_pipeline.py) builds message-style fields, computes token lengths, and optionally emits bucketed shards.

## Stage Reference
- [`filter_problems`](scripts/filter_problems.py): Required first step - see [How filter_problems Filters Data](#how-filter_problems-filters-data) section for filtering details and [How To Use](#how-to-use) section for the input file requirements. Accepts `input_file`, `output_dir`, and optional field names (`problem_field`, `expected_answer_field`, `id_field`). Supports deduplication (`deduplicate`), removal of samples with image references (`remove_images`), MCQ option counting (`num_options`), and an option regex check (`option_format_regex`). Produces `final_result.jsonl` where each record has:
  - `problem`: normalized question text.
  - `expected_answer`: retained or cleared depending on `remove_expected_answer`.
  - `id`: original or auto-generated identifier.
  - `metadata`: dictionary with all other fields from the input sample.
- [`decontaminate`](scripts/decontaminate.py): Retrieves near duplicates, runs model-based contamination checks, and writes a cleaned `final_result.jsonl` containing only non-contaminated problems plus inherited fields.
- [`topics_labeling`](run_pipeline.py): Iteratively labels topics/subtopics by preparing inputs with [`prepare_topics.py`](scripts/prepare_topics.py) and a prompt such as [`topics_labeling.yaml`](prompt/configs/topics_labeling.yaml). Outputs per-level directories and a final `final_result.jsonl` where each problem receives new keys matching the `generation_keys` (for example `topic`, `subtopic`). Few-shot expectations:
  - Provide a mapping in [`prompt/few_shots/`](prompt/few_shots/) with the same name as `few_shots_name`.
  - For each generation key, include examples keyed by the label (e.g., `"topic": {"Chemistry": "Example..."}`) so the prompt can display realistic exemplars.
  - For hierarchical labeling, nest dictionaries by previously chosen label (`"subtopic": {"Chemistry": {"Organic Chemistry": "..."}}`).
- [`generate_solutions`](run_pipeline.py): Runs generation (`generation_kwargs`) and extracts predictions via [`extract_predictions.py`](scripts/extract_predictions.py); optional judging uses the `math_judge` flow, and [`aggregate_solutions.py`](scripts/aggregate_solutions.py) consolidates metrics. Key outputs, all under the configured `output_dir`, include:
  - `generation/output*.jsonl`: raw generations.
  - `with_predictions/output*.jsonl`: adds `predicted_answer`, and when the majority answer is applied, also adds `expected_answer`, `majority_voting_agreement_rate`, and `majority_voting_agreement_at_n`.
  - Optional `judgement/output*.jsonl`: contains `judgement` strings when `make_judgement` is enabled. The aggregated stage output also adds `is_correct`, `generation_model_pass_rate`, `generation_model_pass_at_n`, and `generation_model` to each sample.
- [`profiling`](run_pipeline.py): Requires GT answers. Runs multiple models in parallel, each through a generate-judge-aggregate chain. Uses [`remove_redundant_fields.py`](scripts/remove_redundant_fields.py) to keep baseline keys, generates boxed-format solutions per model, judges them, and writes `final_result.jsonl` with a `profiling` array field containing per-model `{model, pass_rate, pass_at_n}` entries (see [`aggregate_profiling_model.py`](scripts/aggregate_profiling_model.py) and [`merge_profiling.py`](scripts/merge_profiling.py)).
- [`aggregate`](scripts/aggregate_metadata.py): Merges metadata (`metadata_files`) and optional solution glob (`solutions_path`) into `final_result.jsonl`. The resulting records combine base fields with appended metadata and solution statistics.
- [`prepare_for_sft`](run_pipeline.py): Calls `nemo_skills.training.prepare_data` via the configured `prepare_data_kwargs` (tokenizer, prompt config, formatting toggles). Outputs an instruction-tuning JSONL file.
- [`filter_solutions`](scripts/filter_solutions.py): Applies correctness/pass-rate/metadata filters. Parameters: `only_correct_solutions`, `generation_model_pass_rate_range`, `profiling_pass_rate_range` (JSON dict `{model_name: [min, max]}`), `metadata_values`, `only_samples_with_ground_truth_answer`. The filtered output preserves the same schema as the input `final_result.jsonl`.
- [`process_messages_and_bucket`](run_pipeline.py): Uses [`scripts/process_messages_and_bucket.py`](scripts/process_messages_and_bucket.py) to transform prepared rows into input/output message text, compute `input_token_length` and `output_token_length`, and optionally split into token-length buckets based on `bucket_field` and `bucket_sizes`.
- [`validate`](scripts/validate_pipeline.py): Reuses the automated checker to verify artifacts exist, counts add up, and required metadata fields are present, so failures point directly to the problematic stage. See [What the Validation Stage Covers](#what-the-validation-stage-covers) for details and caveats.

## Config Layout
- **Base pipeline**: [`configs/pipelines/base.yaml`](configs/pipelines/base.yaml) describes the default open-question flow with ground-truth answers available, no tool usage, and the [`boxed`](../../../nemo_skills/prompt/config/generic/general-boxed.yaml) prompt.
- **Settings overrides** (under [`configs/settings/`](configs/settings/)) layer small, reusable tweaks. Reference them with or without the `.yaml` suffix:
  - `without_gt` — route the pipeline through solution generation + majority voting to estimate ground truth answer.
  - `python_enabled` — enable Python tool and sandbox execution.
  - `mcq_4_options` — switch to the [`eval/aai/mcq-4choices`](../../../nemo_skills/prompt/config/eval/aai/mcq-4choices.yaml) prompt for generation.
  - `mcq_10_options` — switch to the [`eval/aai/mcq-10choices`](../../../nemo_skills/prompt/config/eval/aai/mcq-10choices.yaml) prompt for generation.
  - `seed_data` — trim the pipeline to the [Seed Data Flow](#seed-data-flow) used to generate seed datasets. It assumes the dataset has GT answers if not explicitly specified `without_gt`.
  - `seed_data_postprocess` — keep only the generation → filtering → SFT preparation stages for postprocessing above existing seed data.
  - `multiple_prompts` — allow the usage of multiple prompts for the generation. Section [Using the multiple_prompts Setting](#using-the-multiple-prompts-setting) describes the setting in detail.
  - `kimi_k2` — reroute `generate_solutions` to the Kimi-K2-Thinking model.

Launch the pipeline by selecting the base config and stacking the overrides you need:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py \
  --pipeline base \
  --settings without_gt python_enabled \
  --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm
```
Settings are merged in the order you pass them; later entries win when they touch the same keys (for example, supply `without_gt` before `python_enabled`). You can also point to custom override files by adding their absolute paths to the `--settings` list.

## Usage Examples
- **With GT, no tools, openq** (default):

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py \
    --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm
  ```

- **Seed data (metadata only)**:

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py \
    --settings seed_data \
    --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm
  ```

- **Seed data plus answer recovery** (run `without_gt` after `seed_data` to re-enable generation):

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py \
    --settings seed_data without_gt \
    --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm
  ```

- **Multiple prompts with custom problem template via CLI overrides**:

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py \
    --settings multiple_prompts \
    --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm \
               stages.filter_problems.problem_template='{problem}'
  ```

- **Solutions-only run**: reuse the provided toggle and stack it with whatever other settings you need.

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py \
    --settings seed_data_postprocess without_gt python_enabled \
    --override input_file=$INPUT_FILE cluster=slurm
  ```

Settings merge recursively, so combining (for example) `seed_data` and `mcq_4_options` simply updates the overlapping stage configuration without reintroducing skipped stages. All settings can be applied in any order except for `seed_data` and `without_gt`—`seed_data` should always be applied before `without_gt`.

## How `filter_problems` Filters Data
1. Normalizes field names based on the configured aliases (`problem_field`, `expected_answer_field`, `id_field`).
2. Optionally drops the GT answer when `remove_expected_answer` is true so majority voting can recompute it later.
3. Deduplicates by exact `problem` text when `deduplicate` is true.
4. Removes entries referencing images or documents if `remove_images` is set.
5. Enforces MCQ option counts (`num_options`), which currently support choices formatted as `{LETTER})`, and optional formatting checks (`option_format_regex`).
6. Moves any extra keys into `metadata` to keep downstream fields consistent.

## Using the `multiple_prompts` Setting
The `multiple_prompts` override enables per-sample prompts and answer extraction hints. To make it work:
- include a `prompt` field in each input record; `filter_problems` renders the final question with `problem_template="{prompt}\n\n{problem}"`, so both keys must be present.
- add an `answer_regex` the records. If `extract_from_boxed: true`, the pipeline now falls back to the boxed parser automatically so you can omit the regex (or leave it as an empty string). For other formats, keep providing a regex to steer answer extraction.
- optionally provide a `num_options` integer so the stage can drop malformed MCQs. The checker counts options that follow the `\n\nA)` / `\nB)` / … pattern with consecutive uppercase letters starting at `A`, and rejects the sample if the detected count differs from `num_options`.
- remember that JSON requires escaping backslashes inside strings. For example, to match a boxed answer you must encode the regex as `\\\\boxed\\{([A-Z])\\}` so that it becomes `\\boxed\{([A-Z])\}` after parsing.

Example fixture entry:

```json
{
  "id": "example-1",
  "prompt": "Select the correct option and finish with 'Answer: <letter>'.",
  "problem": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?\n\nA) Earth\nB) Mars\nC) Jupiter\nD) Venus",
  "num_options": 4,
  "answer_regex": "Answer: ([A-D])(?![A-Za-z])"
}
```

## What the Validation Stage Covers
The validation stage is a lightweight smoke test that ensures the pipeline produced the artifacts we expect:

- Checks every enabled stage emitted `final_result.jsonl`, counts the records, and enforces expected cross-stage consistency constraints (including message-processing outputs when `process_messages_and_bucket` is enabled).
- Verifies key metadata fields (topics, difficulty, solution stats, etc.) are present in representative samples based on which upstream stages ran.
- For `without_gt` settings, asserts that expected answers are absent/present in the right stages and that majority-voting metadata exists.

However, validation does **not** execute the pipeline stages themselves and cannot detect every failure mode:

- It cannot tell whether a stage produced semantically correct data, only whether files exist and basic counts/fields look plausible.
- Some stages are expected to shrink the dataset (for example `filter_solutions`), so validation only checks for monotonic decreases in specific places and might miss a misconfigured filter that drops too much data.
- Runtime issues that prevent a stage from running at all are caught, but partial failures inside a stage’s script (e.g., silently dropping columns) may go unnoticed if the final JSONL still satisfies the structural checks.

Use validation as an automated sanity check, but rely on stage logs and targeted inspections when debugging data-quality issues.

## How to Use
- It is highly recommended to always schedule `filter_problems` first (except when running `seed_data_postprocess`). It prepares the data in the format expected by the pipeline. Input must be JSONL with `problem` (required), plus optional GT answer and id fields. Any additional keys are automatically preserved inside `metadata`. To replace the provided GT answer with the majority-voted result, set `remove_expected_answer: true`.
- Ensure questions are fully formatted before ingest (e.g., multiple-choice options included).
- You can replace [`scripts/filter_solutions.py`](scripts/filter_solutions.py) with a project-specific filter while keeping its CLI contract.
